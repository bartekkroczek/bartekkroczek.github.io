I’m a **data scientist** with an academic fervor. I use my technical background to solve problems in the field of **psychology** and **cognitive sciences**. Currently, I’m mainly dealing with my doctoral dissertation on the phenomenon of **behavioral oscillations**. However, my scientific interests are much broader, so I encourage you to check my blog.

In my free time, I am a salsa teacher and I run a dance school in my hometown. [Fell free to check us](www.forumtanca.pl) :)
