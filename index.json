These concepts are necessary to understand the Fourier transform, which I deal with in my other posts. However, please note that intuitiveness is more important to me than puritanism, which may lead to shortcuts uncomfortable for theoretical mathematicians.\nTable of Contents Disclaimer A simple question that leads to a complex problem Complex number representation Algebraic (canonical) form Ordered pairs Polar coordinates Trigonometric representation Exponential form The magic begins Conclusion References A simple question that leads to a complex problem Itâ€™s usually doesnâ€™t works that way, but the story of the complex number is driven by a simple idea applied to an even simpler equation:\n$$ f(x) = x^2 + 1$$\nOf course, this equation has no solution on the plane of real numbers, which can be easily checked by looking at the graph.\nBut what happened when we forget about the traditional math and solve the equations above as $\\sqrt{-1}$? It turns out that adding such a quantity (usually denoted as $i$) to the rational numbers leads to the creation of a numerical system full of interesting and useful properties, like a field structure 1, which informally means that all classical algebraic operations are allowed.\nWhatâ€™s more this field is algebraically closed2 which - in relation to complex numbers\nmeans that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. In the world of complex numbers, any equation is solvable! This statement is so important that we call this Fundamental Theorem of Algebra3 Complex number representation Complex numbers can be presented in various forms, each of them allows you to use their different properties.\nAlgebraic (canonical) form Letâ€™s define a complex number as $z = a + bi$ where, $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (are rational) and $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ as described above.\nBasic algebraic operations look as follow:\n$$ (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a +c) + (b+d)i $$ $$(a+bi) \\cdot (c+di) = ac + ibc + aid + ibid = ac + i (bc + ad) + i^2 bd = (ac-bd) + i(bc+ad)$$ $$\\frac{a+bi}{c+di} = \\frac{ac + bd}{c^2 + d^2} + i \\frac{bc-ad}{c^2 + d^2}, c^2 + d^2 \\not = 0$$\nWhatâ€™s more interesting, each complex number (and itâ€™s inverse) has root in the form:\n$$a + bi = \\bigg ( \\sqrt{a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} + i\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} (-a + \\sqrt{a^2+b^2})} \\bigg ) ^2$$\nThis form allows for convenient counting using complex numbers.\nOrdered pairs Complex numbers may be introduced as the set of pairs of real numbers, $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Please note, that this is this same $a$ and $b$ like in $z = a+bi$, so the relation between pairs and algebraic representation is trivial. This form is useful for formal construction of complex numbers4 and introduces an idea of representing a complex number as a point in two-dimensional space, which leads to geometrical interpretation.\nAlgebraic operations have very nice interpretations on the Cartesian plane. Addition follows the known parallelogram rule for vectors Multiplying by $i$ is a 90-degree ($\\frac{\\pi}{2}$) rotation. Note that from this perspective $ i^2 = -1$ makes perfect sense. Any other multiplication is just a rotation in point $(0,0)$ by some angle (described in the next paragraph) and rescaling (stretch or shorten) of the vector.\nPolar coordinates The rotation angle announced above is written as $\\theta$, and the scaling factor is called $r$. The relationship between the algebraic and trigonometric notations is only slightly more complicated, and requires some basic knowledge of trigonometry.\nFor $z = a + bi$ $r$ is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.\n$$ r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$\nIn turn, $\\theta$ is just a definition of the inverse of the tangent ($arctg$)\n$$ \\theta = arctg(\\frac{b}{a}) $$\nImportantly, note that again we are dealing with a pair of values, so the correct notation is: $z = (r, \\theta)$\nThis character is convenient because it makes multiplication so much easier:\n$$ (r_1, \\theta_1) \\cdot (r_2, \\theta_2) = (r_1 r_2, \\theta_1 + \\theta_2) $$\nIt is also a bridge to more sophisticated representations.\nTrigonometric representation But how do you express a complex number using polar coordinates but as one number ( not a pair, analogus to $z = a + bi$) ? Once again, trigonometry comes in handy, namely the definition of the sine and cosine functions.\nBy definition:\n$$sin (\\theta) =\\frac{b}{r}, cos (\\theta) = \\frac{a}{r}$$\nso\n$$a = r cos(\\theta) , b = r sin(\\theta)$$\nSubstituting the values calculated above into the equation $z = a + bi$ we get:\n$$z = a + bi = r cos (\\theta) + i r sin (\\theta) = r \\big ( cos (\\theta) + i sin (\\theta) \\big )$$\nThis form, although very useful (it is embedded in the Fourier transform itself), is not convenient for counting. However this problem can be solved by a clever trick, what the next paragraph will be about.\nExponential form We need to start with a few â€¦","date":1611878400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643464326,"objectID":"670a9f3464e5d942346ded0343a5689d","permalink":"https://bartekkroczek.netlify.app/post/five-faces-of-complex-numbers/","publishdate":"2021-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/five-faces-of-complex-numbers/","section":"post","summary":"Disclaimer The purpose of this article is to briefly and intuitively recall the most important properties of complex numbers.
